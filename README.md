An app used to more easily, quickly, and efficiently calculate how much insulin you need for a meal for diabetics.

This app was originally intended to just be made for myself, however close to the end of making the app I thought that I could make the app open-source. 
Since I didn't really intend for it to become open-source I didn't really focus on making the app as well-coded as you probably would when expecting others to work with the code.
Combine this with the fact that I have never made code for someone else to work with, and me being pretty new to Godot (which is the game engine used for this app),
the project is probably not super well structured. Therefore, you are forbidden by law to criticize my code, or I will send 500 ninjas to assasinate you during your sleep.
